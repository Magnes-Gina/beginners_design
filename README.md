My first Python Visualization Project
This program reads a file data.xml which contains a dump of [https://hardwarerecs.stackexchange.com] and cleans the file to remove all HTML attributes and the special characters. The cleaned data is analysed to produce two graphs on number of questions and answers in each quarter and number of unique words in each post.
